# Configuration (`workbench.yaml`)

Runtime behavior is driven by a single YAML file, conventionally named
`workbench.yaml`. The runtime loads it at startup and validates it
against a strict schema.

**Workspaces, knowledge bases, and execution services are not in
config.** They're runtime data, mutable via the HTTP API.
`workbench.yaml` decides two things:

1. Where that data is persisted (the **control-plane backend**).
2. Optionally, which **seed workspaces** to load into the memory
   backend at startup.

## Resolution order

The runtime looks for the config file in this order and takes the
first match:

1. `--config <file>` CLI flag.
2. `WORKBENCH_CONFIG` environment variable.
3. `./workbench.yaml` in the process working directory.
4. `./examples/workbench.yaml` — the sample config this runtime
   ships with. Lets `npm run dev` work out-of-the-box when run from
   the runtime directory.
5. `/etc/workbench/workbench.yaml` (the Docker image default).

No cross-source merging — config is a single declarative document.
`--config` and `WORKBENCH_CONFIG` are returned verbatim; they fail
loudly if the target doesn't exist rather than silently falling
through to the next step.

## Environment variable interpolation

Any string value may reference an environment variable with `${VAR}`
or `${VAR:-default}` syntax. Interpolation happens before schema
validation.

```yaml
controlPlane:
  driver: astra
  endpoint: ${ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT}
  tokenRef: env:ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN
```

References to unset variables without a default fail loudly at
startup.

**Note:** `tokenRef` above is a `SecretRef` string, not an
interpolation. Secret refs are resolved at use time by the runtime's
`SecretResolver`, which is separate from YAML interpolation. See
[§ Secrets](#secrets) below.

## Top-level schema

```yaml
version: 1                          # required
runtime: { port, logLevel, ... }    # optional, with defaults
controlPlane: { driver, ... }       # optional, default: memory
seedWorkspaces: [ ... ]             # optional, memory-only
```

### `version`

Schema version. Currently `1`. The runtime refuses to start on an
unknown version.

### `runtime`

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `environment` | enum | `development` | `development \| production`. Production mode enforces durable persistence, enabled auth, rejected anonymous traffic, HTTPS `publicOrigin`, and a persistent OIDC session secret when browser login is configured. |
| `port` | int | `8080` | HTTP listen port |
| `logLevel` | enum | `info` | `trace \| debug \| info \| warn \| error`. The `LOG_LEVEL` env var overrides this when set. |
| `requestIdHeader` | string | `X-Request-Id` | Name of the request-ID header |
| `uiDir` | string \| null | `null` | Directory of pre-built UI assets to serve from `/` (with SPA fallback). `null` auto-detects `/app/public` → `${cwd}/public` → `${cwd}/apps/web/dist`. The `UI_DIR` env var also works as an override. The official Docker image sets this up automatically. |
| `replicaId` | string \| null | `null` | Identifier this replica writes into job leases (used by the cross-replica orphan sweeper to tell whose lease is whose). `null` auto-generates `${HOSTNAME or "wb"}-<short-uuid>` at boot — fine for single-replica deployments and tests; set explicitly for clustered runs if you want the lease holder to be deterministic. |
| `publicOrigin` | URL \| null | `null` | Externally visible browser origin, e.g. `https://workbench.example.com`. Used for OIDC redirect URI construction and secure-cookie decisions. Required for production OIDC browser login. |
| `trustProxyHeaders` | boolean | `false` | Trust `X-Forwarded-Proto` / `X-Forwarded-Host` when `publicOrigin` is not set. Also extends to the rate limiter (`X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP`). Enable only behind a trusted proxy that overwrites those headers. |
| `rateLimit` | object | (defaults below) | In-process per-IP rate limiter. See [§ Rate limiting](#rate-limiting). |

Production deployments should start from
[`runtimes/typescript/examples/workbench.production.yaml`](../runtimes/typescript/examples/workbench.production.yaml).

#### Rate limiting

Defense-in-depth limiter applied to `/api/v1/*` (capacity from
config) and `/auth/*` (a tighter fixed cap of 30 req/window — login
flows shouldn't burst). Per-IP, per-replica fixed window. Distributed
deployments should still front the runtime with an upstream WAF /
API gateway for accurate aggregate ceilings; this layer protects
against runaway clients and naive scanners.

```yaml
runtime:
  rateLimit:
    enabled: true        # default
    capacity: 600        # max requests per window per IP for /api/v1/*
    windowMs: 60000      # window length, ms
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Set `false` to skip the limiter entirely. |
| `capacity` | int (1–1_000_000) | `600` | Per-IP requests per window for `/api/v1/*`. The auth surface uses a fixed `30`. |
| `windowMs` | int (1000–3_600_000) | `60000` | Window length in milliseconds. |

Rejected requests get `429 Too Many Requests` with the canonical
error envelope, a `Retry-After` header (seconds), and
`X-RateLimit-{Limit,Remaining,Reset}` headers on every response.
Client IP is derived from the socket; set
`runtime.trustProxyHeaders: true` to honor `X-Forwarded-For` /
`X-Real-IP` instead.

### `controlPlane`

Picks where workspaces, knowledge bases, execution services, and RAG
documents are persisted. Discriminated on `driver`.

#### `memory` (default)

```yaml
controlPlane:
  driver: memory
```

In-process `Map`s. State is lost when the runtime exits. Best for CI,
tests, ephemeral demos, and `docker run` with no external
dependencies. If you don't specify a `controlPlane` block at all,
this is what you get.

#### `file`

```yaml
controlPlane:
  driver: file
  root: /var/lib/workbench
```

JSON-on-disk. One file per table, per-table mutex, atomic rename on
writes. Single-node self-hosted. Not safe for multiple writers — if
you run two containers pointing at the same directory, they'll
clobber each other.

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `root` | string | yes | Directory that will hold `workspaces.json` et al. Created if absent. |

#### `astra`

```yaml
controlPlane:
  driver: astra
  endpoint: https://<db-id>-<region>.apps.astra.datastax.com
  tokenRef: env:ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN
  keyspace: workbench
```

Astra Data API Tables via `@datastax/astra-db-ts`. Production-grade,
multi-writer-safe.

> **Tip — astra-cli auto-config.** If you have the
> [`astra` CLI](https://github.com/datastax/astra-cli) installed and a
> profile configured, you can leave `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN` and
> `ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT` unset locally — the runtime will pick them
> up from the CLI at startup. Production deployments inject them from
> a secret manager and the CLI integration is automatically inert.
> See [`astra-cli.md`](astra-cli.md).

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `endpoint` | URL | yes | Astra Data API endpoint |
| `tokenRef` | SecretRef | yes | Pointer to the application token (`env:…` / `file:…`) |
| `keyspace` | string | no (default `workbench`) | Keyspace hosting the `wb_*` control-plane tables |
| `jobPollIntervalMs` | int (50–60000) | `500` | Cross-replica job-subscriber poll interval in ms. Each subscribed `(workspace, jobId)` pair is re-read at this cadence so SSE clients on a different replica from the worker still see updates. Same-replica updates fan out instantly; the poller is a no-op when no one is subscribed. Raise for cost-sensitive deployments where second-scale staleness is fine; lower for hot SSE paths. Astra-only — `memory` and `file` are single-replica by definition. |
| `jobsResume` | object | off | Cross-replica orphan-sweeper config. See below. |

The runtime creates the `wb_*` tables at startup if they don't exist
(using `createTable(..., { ifNotExists: true })`). The keyspace
itself must already exist.

#### `controlPlane.jobsResume` (memory / file / astra)

Off by default — only useful for clustered deployments where one
replica can crash mid-ingest while another stays up. Single-replica
operators don't need it (their pipelines always fail-fast on the
same process). When enabled, every replica scans the durable job
store on an interval for `running` jobs whose lease is older than
the grace window and CAS-claims them. Jobs with a persisted ingest
snapshot replay the pipeline idempotently; older rows without a
snapshot still become terminal `failed` records so SSE clients do
not hang forever. See
[`cross-replica-jobs.md`](cross-replica-jobs.md).

```yaml
controlPlane:
  driver: astra
  endpoint: https://...
  tokenRef: env:ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN
  jobsResume:
    enabled: true
    graceMs: 60000     # how stale a lease must be before reclaim
    intervalMs: 60000  # how often each replica scans
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Set to `true` to start the sweeper. Off by default; clustered deployments opt in. |
| `graceMs` | int (1000–600000) | `60000` | Maximum age of a lease (relative to last heartbeat) before the job is considered orphaned. |
| `intervalMs` | int (1000–600000) | `60000` | How often each replica scans for stale leases. |

Heartbeats are stamped on every progress update (`processed`
ticking, status flipping), so any active worker keeps its lease
fresh. Each replica writes its own `replicaId` (see
[`runtime.replicaId`](#runtime)) into `leasedBy` so the sweeper can
tell what claim belongs to whom.

### `seedWorkspaces` *(memory only)*

Optional list of workspace records loaded into the memory backend at
startup. Lets developers skip the `POST /api/v1/workspaces` dance
when running locally.

```yaml
seedWorkspaces:
  - name: demo
    kind: mock
  - name: prod-astra
    kind: astra
    url: env:ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT
    credentials:
      token: env:ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN
    keyspace: workbench
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `name` | string | yes | Workspace name |
| `kind` | enum | yes | `astra \| hcd \| openrag \| mock` |
| `uid` | UUID | no (auto-generated) | Only useful if other seeds reference it |
| `url` | URL or SecretRef | no | Workspace-specific data-plane URL |
| `credentials` | map<string, SecretRef> | no | Per-key secret pointers |
| `keyspace` | string | no | Workspace-specific keyspace |

Using `seedWorkspaces` with any driver other than `memory` is a
validation error — workspaces already persist in the backend, so
there's nothing to seed.

## Embedding services and vectorize-on-ingest

Embedding services are workspace-scoped *runtime data* — created via
`POST /api/v1/workspaces/{w}/embedding-services`, not in
`workbench.yaml`. The yaml only seeds workspaces; everything past
that flows through the API. Embedding services control how the
runtime turns text into vectors during ingest and search.

The runtime supports two execution paths:

- **Client-side embedding (the default).** The runtime resolves
  `endpointBaseUrl` + `endpointPath` + `credentialRef`, calls the
  provider's HTTP API at ingest / search time, and writes the
  resulting vectors to Astra. Works with any embedding provider
  (OpenAI, Cohere, NVIDIA NIM, self-hosted, etc.) — the runtime
  carries the bytes.
- **Vectorize-on-ingest (server-side, Astra-only).** When the
  embedding service has `provider: "astra"` *and* the bound vector
  collection was created with a matching Astra `service` block (e.g.
  `nvidia:nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5`), the runtime delegates embedding
  to Astra's `$vectorize` column type. Documents are upserted with
  raw text; Astra runs the embedding model in its own infrastructure
  and stores both the text and the vector. Search likewise sends the
  query as text and Astra embeds it server-side.

The vectorize path is faster on hot paths (no extra round-trip to a
provider), simpler to operate (no provider credential lives on the
runtime), and avoids the dimension-mismatch class of errors. Two
constraints to know:

1. **The embedding service and the collection must agree.** Creating
   a knowledge base with `provider: "astra"` materializes the Astra
   collection with the service block baked in. Changing the embedding
   service binding on an existing KB is rejected if the dimension or
   provider doesn't match what the collection was provisioned with.
2. **`credentialRef` is irrelevant on the runtime side.** Astra
   itself holds whatever provider credentials the vectorize service
   needs; the runtime never sees them. Setting `credentialRef` on a
   `provider: "astra"` embedding service is a no-op.

Mixed-batch upserts (some records carry a precomputed `vector`,
others carry `text`) always fall back to client-side embedding so
the entire batch lands in one transactional call. See
[`api-spec.md`](api-spec.md) §`POST /{knowledgeBaseId}/records` for
the exact dispatch rules.

## `chat` *(optional)*

Wires up the runtime-wide default chat-completion executor used by
agents that have no `llmServiceId` of their own. When unset and
the agent also has no LLM service bound, agent send + streaming
return `503 chat_disabled`. See [`agents.md`](agents.md) for the
agent surface and the per-agent LLM-service binding.

```yaml
chat:
  tokenRef: env:HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
  model: mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
  maxOutputTokens: 1024
  retrievalK: 6
  systemPrompt: null
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `tokenRef` | SecretRef | required | Resolved once at boot. `env:VAR` or `file:/path`. |
| `model` | string | `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` | Any chat-completion-compatible HuggingFace Inference API model. |
| `maxOutputTokens` | int (1–8192) | `1024` | Per-turn cap on the assistant's reply length. |
| `retrievalK` | int (1–64) | `6` | Top-K KB chunks **per knowledge base**. The total injected into the prompt is `retrievalK * ceil(sqrt(numKbs))` so multi-KB conversations don't blow up the prompt. |
| `systemPrompt` | string \| null | `null` | Default system prompt when neither the agent nor the agent's LLM service supplies one. `null` falls back to the runtime's persona-agnostic `DEFAULT_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`. |

**Per-agent override.** When an agent has `llmServiceId` set, the
agent's bound LLM service overrides this block — the runtime
instantiates a chat service from the LLM-service record instead of
using the global block. The agent's own `systemPrompt` likewise
wins over `chat.systemPrompt` when present. Multi-provider support
is a follow-up; today only `provider: "huggingface"` LLM services
are wired end-to-end.

## `mcp` *(optional)*

Toggles the Model Context Protocol façade at
`/api/v1/workspaces/{w}/mcp`. Off by default — when disabled the
route returns `404` so the surface isn't probeable. See
[`mcp.md`](mcp.md) for the full feature walkthrough.

```yaml
mcp:
  enabled: true
  exposeChat: false
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | When false, MCP is not exposed at all. |
| `exposeChat` | bool | `false` | Adds the `chat_send` MCP tool. Requires the `chat:` block; silently skipped when chat is unset. |

## `auth`

Configures the `/api/v1/*` auth middleware. See
[`auth.md`](auth.md) for the full contract and rollout plan.

```yaml
auth:
  mode: disabled          # disabled | apiKey | oidc | any
  anonymousPolicy: allow  # allow | reject
  # oidc: …               # required when mode is `oidc` or `any`
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `mode` | enum | `disabled` | Which verifiers are active. |
| `anonymousPolicy` | enum | `allow` | `allow` lets tokenless requests through as anonymous; `reject` returns `401 unauthorized`. |
| `bootstrapTokenRef` | SecretRef \| null | `null` | Optional 32+ character break-glass bearer token. Accepted as an unscoped operator subject when `mode` is `apiKey`, `oidc`, or `any`; invalid with `mode: disabled`. |
| `oidc` | object | — | Required when `mode` is `oidc` or `any`. See table below. |

The default (`disabled` + `allow`) matches pre-auth behavior: the
middleware runs, tags every request anonymous, and lets it
through. Set `anonymousPolicy: reject` in CI to assert the
middleware is mounted.

### `auth.oidc`

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `issuer` | url | required | Must equal the JWT `iss` claim exactly. Discovery URL is derived from this. |
| `audience` | string \| string[] | required | At least one value must match the JWT `aud` claim. |
| `jwksUri` | url \| null | `null` | When null, the runtime fetches `${issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration` at startup and uses `jwks_uri` from the response. |
| `clockToleranceSeconds` | int | `30` | Skew allowance for `exp` / `nbf`. |
| `claims.subject` | string | `sub` | JWT claim → `AuthSubject.id`. |
| `claims.label` | string | `email` | JWT claim → `AuthSubject.label` (nullable). |
| `claims.workspaceScopes` | string | `wb_workspace_scopes` | Array-valued claim → `AuthSubject.workspaceScopes`. A JSON `null` marks the subject unscoped (admin). |
| `client` | object | — | Optional. When present, the runtime hosts `/auth/{login,callback,me,logout}` so the bundled web UI can drive a browser PKCE login. See table below. |

#### `auth.oidc.client`

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `clientId` | string | required | OAuth client identifier registered at the IdP. |
| `clientSecretRef` | SecretRef \| null | `null` | Client secret. Omit for public (SPA-style) clients. |
| `redirectPath` | string | `/auth/callback` | Path the IdP redirects to after authorization. Must be in the IdP's allow-list. |
| `postLogoutPath` | string | `/` | Where `/auth/logout` sends the user. |
| `scopes` | string[] | `[openid, profile, email]` | OAuth scopes requested at login. |
| `sessionCookieName` | string | `wb_session` | Cookie that carries the encrypted session. |
| `sessionSecretRef` | SecretRef \| null | `null` | Key material for encrypting session cookies. Must resolve to ≥32 bytes. When null, runtime auto-generates an ephemeral key at boot (dev only). |

## Secrets

Secrets reach the runtime through two disjoint paths:

### YAML interpolation (`${VAR}`)

Applies before schema validation. Good for non-secret runtime
settings like endpoints, and for pulling secrets that need to be
**literal strings** in the config document.

### Secret refs (`env:` / `file:`)

The preferred path for anything credential-shaped. A `SecretRef` is a
string like `env:ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN` or
`file:/etc/workbench/secrets/astra-token`. The runtime resolves it
when it actually needs the secret (at control-plane init, for
example), so the value never lives in memory longer than necessary
and never crosses process logs.

Providers available today:

| Provider | Ref shape | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `env` | `env:VAR_NAME` | Reads `process.env.VAR_NAME`. Errors if unset or empty. |
| `file` | `file:/abs/path` | Reads the file and trims trailing whitespace. |

Future providers (Vault, AWS SM, etc.) plug into the same
`SecretProvider` interface. See
[`runtimes/typescript/src/secrets/provider.ts`](../runtimes/typescript/src/secrets/provider.ts).

## Validation rules

At startup the runtime enforces:

- Every `${VAR}` reference resolves or has a default.
- `controlPlane.driver` is one of `memory | file | astra`.
- Driver-specific required fields are present (e.g. `root` for file,
  `endpoint` + `tokenRef` for astra).
- Every `tokenRef` / `credentials` value matches the
  `<prefix>:<path>` shape.
- `seedWorkspaces` is only non-empty when
  `controlPlane.driver == memory`.
- No duplicate names within `seedWorkspaces`.

Validation failures abort startup with a non-zero exit code and a
human-readable error message.

## Hot reload

Not supported. The current model is "restart the process to pick up
changes." Since only the control-plane backend is configured here
(workspaces themselves are runtime data), most day-to-day operations
don't require a config change anyway.

## Graceful shutdown

`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` trigger a graceful-shutdown sequence:

1. `/readyz` starts returning `503 draining`. Kubernetes-style
   readiness probes will stop routing traffic here.
2. `server.close()` stops accepting new connections. In-flight
   requests keep going.
3. When every connection finishes (or after 15 seconds, whichever
   comes first), the control-plane store closes and the process
   exits `0`. A timeout exits `1` so the supervisor knows we didn't
   drain cleanly.
4. A second `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` while the first is still draining
   short-circuits straight to exit — the operator can force-kill a
   stuck process without waiting for the timeout.

`/healthz` stays `200` throughout the drain (the process is still
alive, just closed to new traffic). That's the split that k8s
expects — `livenessProbe` hits `/healthz`, `readinessProbe` hits
`/readyz`.

## `.env` file (dev convenience)

The runtime auto-loads a `.env` file at startup so local dev doesn't
need you to `export` secrets by hand. Uses Node 21.7+'s built-in
`process.loadEnvFile` — no `dotenv` dependency.

**Location.** Put it at the **repo root**. The runtime walks up from
the process's current working directory looking for `.env`, stopping
at the repo root (`.git` sentinel). That means the same file works
whether you run `npm run dev` from the repo root or from
`runtimes/typescript/`.

**Precedence.** Values already present in `process.env` win —
`.env` never overwrites shell exports or container env vars. Matches
every other dotenv loader.

**Override the path.** Set `WORKBENCH_ENV_FILE=/abs/path/to/.env` to
skip the walk and load an explicit file (missing files fail loudly).
Useful for production container boots where the token lives on a
mounted secret.

**Template.** [`.env.example`](../.env.example) at the repo root is
a committed starting point — copy to `.env` and fill in the secrets
you need. `.env` itself is gitignored.

**Production.** The runtime ships the same loader in production, but
standard container practice (Docker `-e` / K8s Secrets → env vars)
usually means no `.env` is present and the loader silently skips.
