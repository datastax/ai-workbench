/**
 * Job types for the async-ingest pipeline.
 *
 * A `Job` is a server-side record of a long-running operation (today:
 * catalog ingest; future: bulk export, reindex, delete). Clients
 * receive a `jobId` when they kick off the work, then poll
 * `GET /jobs/{jobId}` or subscribe via SSE to learn about progress.
 *
 * This slice ships an **in-memory** job store: entries live for the
 * lifetime of the runtime process and are lost on restart. Persistent
 * backends (file, astra) can follow later using the same
 * {@link ./store.JobStore} seam. Recovering in-flight jobs across
 * restart is a separate problem (requires durability + retry) and is
 * explicitly out of scope here.
